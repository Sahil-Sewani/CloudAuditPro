IAM trust policy you can give to customers (or use yourself) so your CloudAuditPro account can assume their CloudAuditProReadRole with an External ID.

What to change

YOUR_CLOUDAUDITPRO_ACCOUNT_ID → replace with the AWS account ID where your CloudAuditPro backend runs (right now that’s your own account).

"cloudauditpro" → this must match the EXTERNAL_ID you put in your .env and use in your code when calling assume_role.

Why this matters

It ensures only your CloudAuditPro account can assume the customer’s role.

It protects against the “confused deputy” problem (that’s what the ExternalId is for).

It lines up with the Python you already wrote.
